# Self‑Declarative Pipelines: A Palantir Foundry Perspective (with Foundry‑Native Examples)

## Collab

## TL;DR
Spark 4.1’s Spark Declarative Pipelines (SDP) popularize a dataset‑centric approach—declare the datasets and queries; let the engine plan and run the graph. In Palantir Foundry, you build the same kind of pipelines using Transforms (@transform, @transform_df, @incremental) that materialize datasets and are orchestrated by Pipelines with scheduling, lineage, and governance built‑in.
